## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
plot(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
summary(pressure)
plot(pressure)
```

-list
   
    -sublist 1
  
    -sublist 2

-list 2


*unordered list

      +sub-item 1
      
      +sub-item 2

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
